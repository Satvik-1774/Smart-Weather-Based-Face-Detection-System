Modern surveillance systems are increasingly reliant on advanced facial recognition. However, these systems often falter when confronted with real-world variability, particularly fluctuating weather conditions. Traditional face recognition models are typically trained and validated in controlled environments where lighting is adequate, visibility is clear, and the visual input is pristine. This results in a significant performance drop when these models are deployed in real-life scenarios involving rain, fog, dust, or low light. Such inconsistencies not only affect recognition accuracy but also compromise the reliability and credibility of the entire surveillance ecosystem.
To address these challenges, the Smart Weather-Based Face Recognition System has been conceptualized as a next-generation surveillance solution. This project introduces a novel, AI-driven architecture that intelligently adapts to environmental changes using an integrated weather classification mechanism. At the core of this system lies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to assess weather conditions by analysing visual input. Depending on the output of this classification, the system dynamically determines whether to proceed with standard face recognition processing or to route the input through a Super-Resolution (SR) enhancement module. This module, based on the EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution) model, enhances low-quality images affected by adverse conditions before they are processed for recognition.
This conditional pipeline design offers two significant advantages: enhanced accuracy and optimized computational efficiency. In clear weather scenarios, the system bypasses unnecessary enhancement operations, reducing processing time and energy consumption. In adverse weather conditions, the system ensures the quality of facial data is improved before attempting recognitionâ€”thereby maintaining high performance regardless of environmental challenges
